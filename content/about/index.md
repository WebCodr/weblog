The topics of webcodr include the nerdy stuff. Programming, cool networking hardware, mechanical keyboards, insights into Apple products (planed) and water-cooling hardware (planed).

Webcodr is based on [Hugo][1], a static site generator written in Go, and hosted on [Netlify][3]. If you're interessted how it works, you can find the main repository with the markup files and the Hugo configuration [here][2].
