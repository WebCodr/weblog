My name is David. I'm a software developer at inovex GmbH in Munich.

The topics of WebCodr include the nerdy stuff. Programming, cool networking hardware, mechanical keyboards, insights into Apple products (planed) and water-cooling hardware (planed).

Currently most articles are written in german. Future articles will be mostly in english, depending on the topic. For example, if an article is about a specific configuration for my ISP (Deutsche Telekom), I will write in german. Programming-related posts etc. will always be written in english.

WebCodr is based on [Hugo][1], a static site generator written in Go, and hosted on [GitHub Pages][3]. If you're interessted how it works, you can find the main repository with the markup files and the Hugo configuration [here][2].
